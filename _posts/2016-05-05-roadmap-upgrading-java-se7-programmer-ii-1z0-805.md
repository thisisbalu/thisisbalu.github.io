People who are already certified for Java SE6 or below versions(Sun Certified Java Programmer-SCJP or Oracle Certified Java Programmer-OCJP) can upgrade to OCP Java SE7 Programmer II. This particular exam 1Z0-805 covers only certain topics.

## Roadmap for Upgrading to OCP Java SE7 Programmer II(1Z0-805) from the previous version of Java

  1. **Language Enhancements** 
      * Develop code that uses String objects in switch statements
      * Develop code that uses binary literals and numeric literals with underscores
      * Develop code that uses try-with-resources statements
      * Develop code that handles multiple exception types in a single catch block
      * Develop code that uses the diamond with generic declarations
  2. **Design Patterns** 
      * Design a class using the singleton design pattern
      * Apply object composition principles
      * Write code to implement the Data Access Object
      * Design and create objects using a factory pattern
  3. **Database Applications with JDBC** 
      * Describe the interfaces that make up the core of the JDBC API (including the Driver, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet interfaces and their relationships to provide implementation)
      * Identify the components required to connect to a database using the DriverManager class (including JDBC URL)
      * Submit queries and read results from the database (including creating Statements, returning result sets, iterating through the results, and properly closing result sets, statements, and connections)
      * Use JDBC transactions (including disabling auto-commit mode, committing and rolling back transactions, and setting and rolling back to savepoints)
      * Construct adn use RowSet objects using the RowSetProvider class and RowSetFactory interface)
      * Create and user PrepareStatement and CallableStatement objects
  4. **Concurrency** 
      * Use collections from the java.util.concurrent package with a focus on the advantages over and differences from the traditional java.util.collections
      * Use Lock, ReadWriteLock, and ReentrantLock classes in the java.util.concurrent.locks package to support lock-free thread-safe programming on single variables
      * Use Execution, Executors, Callable, and Future to execute tasks using thread pools
      * Use the parallel Fork/Join Framework
  5. **Localization** 
      * Read and set the locale using the Locale object
      * Build a resource bundle for each locale
      * Call a resource bundle from an application
      * Format dates, numbers, and currency values for localization with the NumberFormat and DateFormat classes (including number format patterns)
      * Define a locale using language and country codes
  6. **Java File I/O (NIO.2)** 
      * Operate on file and directory paths with the Path class
      * Check, delete, copy or move a file or directory with the FIle class
      * Read and change file and directory attributes, focusing on the BasicFileAttributes, DosFIleAttributes, and PosixFIleAttributes interface
      * Recursively access a directory tree using the DirectoryStream and File Visitor interfaces
      * Find a file with the PathMatcher interface
      * Watch a directory for changes with the WatchService interface
