SVG is trending technology in the internet world. There are many advantages of SVG. In crisp, SVG which stands for [Scalable Vector Graphics][1] is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web. It was introduced by W3C in the year 1999 and it became W3C Recommendation from the year 2001

W3C released three versions of SVG.

  1. SVG 1.0 &#8211; became W3c Recommendation from 4th September, 2001.
  2. SVG 1.1 &#8211; became W3c Recommendation from 14th January, 2003.
  3. SVG 1.1(Second Version) &#8211; became W3c Recommendation from 16th August, 2011.

## Advantages of SVG

Lets talk about the Advantages of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) in the following points!

  * **SVGs are Infinitely Scalable** because they are not the raster graphics. They are the Vector Graphics which are the combination of mathematics and calculations, resulting in infinite scalable images on web.
  * **SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor** Yes SVG is text based. We can create the image in a text editor itself by saving it in SVG format. Also there are software available in market to create SVG images, but the resulting image will of words, tags and numbers(Text Based).
  * **SVG images are lighter than other formats.** Just for an instance let talk about the JPG images, they are already heavy for web page. If you want to make JPG expand, it becomes more heavier. But SVGs are not heavier in that case. SVG is always same even if you expand or condense.
  * **SVGs are XML Based** SVG images are of xml tags those are predefined by the W3C. As SVGs are of xml tags they work with other languages too, For an instance we can add styles and animation for SVG through CSS.
  * **SVG images can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.** As these are the text based, they have many possibilities to be SEO friendly. They can be also compressed if you think the image in SVG is bigger in size.
  * **SVG is an Open Source!** The main competitor for SVG is flash. Flash relies on proprietary technology that is not open source, whereas SVG is an open source that had unlimited possibilities with the other technologies like CSS.
