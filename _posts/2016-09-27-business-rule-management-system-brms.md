Business Rule Management System (BRMS) is an integrated application development and execution platform that allows organizations to define, deploy and monitor and maintain the vast variety of Automated decisions used by operational systems. A BRMS allows decision logic to be extracted and managed separately from core application code, so that it can be easily understood, maintained and reused access the organization.

The definition that is given in the above para is in technical terms. To define BRMS in the more general way &#8211;_**Externalizing the Business Condition Logic from the application code so that condition logics(technically called as rules) can be organized easily without disturbing the application.**_ BRMS reduces the application developer dependency. A business user can directly edit business condition rules using BRMS.

## Components of Business Rule Management System

Business Rule Management System should include at least three primary components.<figure id="attachment_1494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1494" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### Rule Repository

A repository allowing rules to be externalized from core application code. The repository allows decision logic to be managed as an enterprise asset, making it easier to understand and update automated, operational decisions. This rule repository also helps in reusing the rule information across the application.

### Tools for both technical and non-technical users to define and manage decision logic in repository

These tools give the business function the ability to define rules that will guide the behavior of operational systems. These tools will facilitate collaboration between the technical and business on application maintenance and development.

### Runtime Engine

A runtime engine allowing systems to access and execute of rules in the engine will be based on specific execution algorithms.
