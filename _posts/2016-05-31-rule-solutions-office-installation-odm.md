  Decision Center publishes action rules and ruleflows as Microsoft Word RuleDocs. Rule Solutions for Office editors integrated with Word let you edit the rules and ruleflows using a natural language syntax. These editors help you use correct business vocabulary and rule syntax through the Intellirule Editor, which is also used in Decision Center. <p>

    <li class="p">
      Decision Center publishes rule decision tables to Microsoft Excel RuleDocs. The Rule Solutions decision table editor in Excel enables you to view and edit sets of similar action rules. You can also use Excel commands to change table properties.
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      You use Rule Solutions for Office and RuleDocs to view, review and edit rules offline. You can also share RuleDocs by email or through a common server to collaborate on their contents with people inside or outside your organization.
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      You can also open a rule directly inside Decision Center to edit it in Rule Solutions without publishing and synchronizing a RuleDoc. When a rule is checked out this way, Decision Center locks it to prevent modification conflicts. No one else can change the rule until it has been checked back in.
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="p">
        <span class="keyword">Rule Solutions</span> synchronizes the changes made to a RuleDoc back to the environment from which the RuleDoc was published. Even if you change the organization of RuleDocs in a folder or move rules from one RuleDoc to another, your RuleDocs still sync back to their source.
