When I have started preparing for the Java Certification(Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 7 Programmer 1Z0-803), I couldn&#8217;t find the topics that should be prepared for the exam. After the referring to the many friends and books, I got the list of topics that we should get prepared.

It would be easy if we prepare the objectives for each topic. Following are the topics and their respective objectives that I will be preparing.

## Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 7 Programmer I (Exam 1Z0-803)

  1. **Java Basics** 
      * Define the scope of variables
      * Define the structure of the Java class
      * Create executable Java applications with main method
      * Import other Java packages to make them accessible in your code
  2. **Working with Java Date Types** 
      * Declare and initialize variables
      * Differentiate between object reference variables and primitive variables
      * Read or write to object fields
      * Explain an object&#8217;s lifecycle (creation, dereference and garbage collection)
      * Call methods on objects
      * Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods
      * Create and manipulate Strings
  3. **Using Operators and Decision Constructs** 
      * Use Java operators
      * Use paratheses to override operator precedence
      * Test equality between Strings and other objects using == and equals()
      * Create if and if/else constructs
      * Use a switch statement
  4. **Creating and Using Arrays** 
      * Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a one-dimensional array
      * Declare, instantiate, initialize and use multi-dimensional array
      * Declare and use an ArrayList
  5. **Using Loop Constructs** 
      * Create and use while loops
      * Create and use for loops including and enhanced for loop
      * Create and use do/while loops
      * Compare loop constructs
      * Use break and continue
  6. **Working with Methods and Encapsulation** 
      * Create methods with arguments and return values
      * Apply the static keyword to methods and fields
      * Create an overloaded method
      * Differentiate between default and user-defined constructors
      * Create and overload constructors
      * Apply access modifiers
      * Apply Encapsulation principles to a class
      * Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed into methods that change the values.
  7. **Working with Inheritance** 
      * Implement inheritance
      * Develop code that demonstrated the use of the polymorphism
      * Differentiate between the type of a reference and the type of an object
      * Determine when casting is necessary
      * Use Super and this to access objects and constructors
      * Use abstract classes and interfaces
  8. **Handling Exceptions** 
      * Differentiate among checked exceptions, unchecked exceptions, and errors
      * Create a try-catch block and determine how exceptions alter normal program flow
      * Describe what exceptions are used for in Java
      * Invoke a method that throws an exception
      * Recognise common exception classes and categories
