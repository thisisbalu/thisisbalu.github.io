Origin of the Name Hadoop is not from an acronym and the name Hadoop doesn&#8217;t have any specific meaning too. It&#8217;s just a made up name! Hadoop Project&#8217;s creator, Doug Cutting, explains how the name came in to existing &#8212;

> &#8220;The name my kid gave a stuffed yellow elephant. Short, relatively easy to spell and pronounce, meaningless, and not used elsewhere. Those are my naming criteria. Kids are good at generating such. Googol is a kid&#8217;s term.&#8221;

Hence it is confirmed that Hadoop is not having any acronym(Full Form) and it doesn&#8217;t have any meaning. In an interview with CNBC, Cutting responded to a question why a non-related meaningless name &#8212;

> &#8220;The rules of names for software is they&#8217;re meaningless because sometimes the use of a particular piece of software drifts, and if your name is too closely associated with that, it could end up being wrong over time.&#8221;

Sub projects and &#8220;contrib&#8221; modules in Hadoop also tend to have names that are unrelated to their function, often with an elephant or other animal theme(Pig and Hive for examples). That&#8217;s the brief story of Origin of the Name Hadoop. Happy Learning! Happy Exploring!
