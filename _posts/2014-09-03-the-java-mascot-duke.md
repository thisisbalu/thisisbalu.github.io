Before knowing about the Duke, The Java Mascot let us know about mascot.

**What is a Mascot?**

A mascot is any person, animal, or object thought to bring luck or anything used to represent a group with a common public identity, such as a school, professional sports team, society, military unit, or brand name. Mascots are also used as fictional, representative spokespeople for consumer products.

**Duke, The Java Mascot**

During the development of Java, Sun Microsystem&#8217;s&#8217; Green Project created its first working demo, an interactive handheld home entertainment controller called the Star 7. At the heart of the animated touch-screen user interface was a cartoon character named Duke.<figure id="attachment_151" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The Jumping and Cartwheeling Duke was designed to

  1. Represent a &#8220;software agent&#8221; that performed tasks for the user.
  2. Interactive host that enabled a new type of user interface that went beyond the buttons, mice, and pop-up menus of the desktop computing world.

**Creator of Duke**

It was created by one of the Team&#8217;s graphic artist Joe Palrang. He went on to work on popular animated movies such as Shrek, Over the Hedge, and Flushed Away. Every year Oracle releases the new Duke Personality.
