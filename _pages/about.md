I am a seasoned Full Stack Java Developer with a rich background spanning over a decade. With a relentless passion for programming, I thrive on learning new technologies on-the-fly and have an impeccable track record of never missing a deadline.

My expertise lies in the end-to-end process of designing, developing, and supporting web applications. Proficient in a diverse array of languages including Java, Python, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JavaScript, and Angular, I bring a wealth of experience to every project. I am particularly adept at crafting robust REST APIs, boasting extensive knowledge of frameworks like Spring Boot and Jersey.

One of my standout achievements includes two years of dedicated work on designing, developing, and supporting OAuth 2.0 frameworks using Spring Security. This experience has honed my ability to create secure and reliable authentication systems.

In addition to my proficiency in web development, I possess a strong foundation in Multi-Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) and Business Rule Management Systems such as JRules and IBM ODM. My expertise extends to BOM Modeling and data management in relational databases like Oracle and Postgres.

With a solid grasp of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented concepts, I am equipped to tackle complex challenges and develop innovative solutions. A team player at heart, I am known for my exceptional analytical and communication skills. I take pride in consistently delivering high-quality work and am equally comfortable working independently or as part of a collaborative effort.
